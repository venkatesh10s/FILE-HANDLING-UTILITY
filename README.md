"DOMAIN": JAVA PROGRAMMING

"DURATION": 4 WEEKS

"MENTOR": NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

This is a simple and powerful **Java-based console application** developed as part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**. The main goal of this project is to provide a utility that can read, write, and modify text files using core Java functionality. The project is designed to be clean, user-friendly, and extendable for any future enhancements.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate **file handling operations** in Java in a structured and interactive manner. The application allows the user to:
- Read a text file line by line
- Overwrite an existing file with new content
- Append content to a separate file

All of these are achieved using **core Java I/O classes** like `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, and `BufferedWriter`.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Java installed** on your system (Java 8 or above).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java files using:
   javac src/*.java

## Run the program using:

java -cp src Main

## Technologies Used:

Java (JDK 8+)

Core Java concepts:

Classes and Objects
Exception Handling
File I/O (java.io)
Loops and Conditionals
User Input via Scanner

## Features:

-Read from an existing text file

-Write (overwrite) content to a file

-Append content to a new file

-Handles invalid input gracefully

-Uses BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for performance

-Organized code into separate classes (Main, FileHandler)

-User-friendly and clear command-line interface
